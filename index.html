    <h1>Future home of something quite cool.</h1>
	<p>This website is under construction. But fear not! Here is some information till then.</p>
	<p>I am <strong>Pradyuman Vig</strong> and am currently a Purdue University Computer Engineering student. 
	I love to code and go to hackathons and recently attended Wildacks 2014 at Northwestern University. <br />
	I will be an intern with Hewlett-Packard starting May 2015 (and will continue to work with HP at a campus office during the school year). <br />
	</p>
	<h2>My recent projects</h2>
	<p><strong>I created two hacks at Wildhacks 2014: </strong><br /><br />
		1. The first hack (which won the Microsoft Azure prize at the competition) was a way to send contact information by shaking hands (using Pebble smartwatches and Android). This hack can also be modified to send payment information by venmo, etc using different gestures (its something that can be done with the way we have coded this hack but it wasn't implemented at the hackathon due to the time constraint). <br />

		<a href="https://github.com/drewski1992/Shake2Share"><strong>Github</strong></a> <br /><br />
		2. The second hack was a way to calculate if a stock price was going to go up or down the following morning using social media and stock history. It displays the three stocks most likely to go up the next day (from the database of stocks given by the Yahoo Finance API). We used the APIs and technology from Yahoo Finance, IBM Bluemix, Paypal, MailJet, and dunnhumby for this hack. <br />
